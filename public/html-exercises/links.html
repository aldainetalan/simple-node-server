            <em>My Top 3 Favorite Films of All-Time</em>
        </p>
            <p>
                The third on my list is <a href= "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1682180/"> Stoker (2013)</a>. I have watched this film multiple times. Of all the psychological/gore films that I have watched, this one is my favorite. The film contains just the right amount of gore scenes and eeriness within its charaters. Also, this film has a very interesting ending.

                My top 2 film goes to <a href= "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0377092/?ref_=tt_rec_tt"> Mean Girls (2004) </a>. This one is a classic. Many chic-flicks have tried to outdo Mean Girls, but they all failed. The script is just so well-written that the characters and some of the lines will remain to you forever. This film is "so fetch"! 
            </p>
            <p> 
                The queen of the list is <a href= "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1229822/"> Jane Eyre (2011)</a>. This film is absoulutely fantastic in terms of the characters and the cinematography. This adaptation of Charlotte BrontÃ«'s Jane Eyre is so good and it gives me different emotions every time I watch it.

            <em>My Top 3 Favorite Songs</em>
        </p>
            <p>
                The third place goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr33jn6hN0c"> Rico Blanco- Your Universe </a>. Rico Blanco is definitely an artist! This song makes me nostalgic every time I listen to it. It just brings back happy high school memories.

                My second favorite is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLK4oaXUuLg"> Two Door Cinema Club- Undercover Martyn </a>. I instantly fell in love with this song, the first time I listened to it. This song was in my playlist for 3 years which made a record in my playlist history. I recommend everyone to check out the amazing album of TDCC called "Tourist" where this song came from.

                My number one favorite is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5S1l8qq7EVA"> Black Kids- Hurricane Jane</a>. My sister introduced me this song when I was in 4th year highschool. I never liked it at first. But after few plays, this song turned out to be very addicting and beautiful. This is now my favorite song especially at times when I want to be lazy and just chill in bed.

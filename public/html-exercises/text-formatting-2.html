    <p>I spent my highschool years in <abbr title="Romblon National High School">RNHS</abbr>. Currently, I am studying <em>Agribusiness Management</em> in <abbr title="University of the Philippines- Los Banos">UPLB</abbr>. The most memorable quotation that I learned in college is that <q>Quality education takes time.</q> which I sometimes use as a funny excuse whenever my mom asks me when will I graduate. I love reading the book <cite>Rich Dad, Poor Dad</cite> by Robert Kiyosaki which was a gift from my sister.</p>
